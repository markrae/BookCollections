# BookCollections
If struggle to keep track of your book collection, then this Android app can help. It allows users to create Shelves and organize their book collection on to them.

# Download Release APKs
Prototype releases can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/markrae/BookCollections/releases).

# Planned Features
* ISBN lookup - All the relevant data for a book is retrieved automatically once the book's ISBN is entered.
* Barcode scanning - Users will be able to simply scan the barcode on the back of books to add them to their shelf.
* Lending & borrowing - A lending/borrowing interface will permit users to enter who they have lent/borrowed a book to/from, the date of the exchange and optionally a date of when they expect the book to be returned to its original owner.
* Tracking purchase info - Listing professional textbooks as a business expense is made easier as the app will produce a read-out of purchases made in a given year.
